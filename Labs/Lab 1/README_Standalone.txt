EE734 Labs in PLECS Standalone

PLECS Version 4.8.1

These EE734 PLECS lab files should be identical to the ones found in the PLECS Blockset version of the file (embedded into Simulink, file extension ".slx"). They are provided for your convenience, and should be identical in functionality to the Simulink version.

There are 3 parts to the question, hence 3 files, as follows:
 - EE734_2024_Student_Lab1-IPT_Q1.plecs
 - EE734_2024_Student_Lab1-IPT_Q2.plecs
 - EE734_2024_Student_Lab1-IPT_Q3.plecs

You can obtain this same result yourself by opening PLECS Standalone and selecting "File -> Import from Blockset". You will need to copy and paste each question subcircuit into different files, which is precisely what I did here.

Note the lab Word document assumes you are using the Blockset version (.slx file) but the differences are not really material to the lab and should be self explanatory. Email / Slack me if there are any issues, I would like to know how to improve these labs.

Its nice to have the option to use PLECS Standalone as it opens faster. Later in your career (or if you're feeling very ambitious with the project) you might find the extended Matlab/Simulink ecosystem useful; its good to be aware that both exist.

Happy lab,
Matthew
